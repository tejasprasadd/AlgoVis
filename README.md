# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. The project demonstrates various sorting algorithms in an interactive and visual way, making it easier to understand how they work step-by-step.

## Features

- **Visual Representation**: Displays bars representing elements of an array, with the height of each bar corresponding to its value.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Shows how different sorting algorithms sort the array in real time, with color changes to indicate comparisons and swaps.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization using a speed slider, ranging from slow to fast.
- **Array Length Control**: Modify the length of the array using a dedicated slider to see how algorithms handle different input sizes.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
